    "# Exercise: Greenland mass change from satellite gravimetry\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE, and it's follow-on GRACE-FO), [have the unique ability to 'weigh' the ice sheets from space](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/grace). The satellite mission uses the principle that satellite orbits are affected by gravitational changes of the Earth. In reversal, a very accurate tracking of the satellite orbits over time allows the determination of mass changes on the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we download and visualize a GRACE CCI product of ice mass change using cate. After the exercise you'll have an idea of the current imbalance of the Greenland icesheet and see where the icesheet is losing mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparations\n",
    "If you haven't done so please follow the [Cate tutorial](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/understanding-climate-change-using-satellite-climate-data/1/steps/1230976) to get started using the Jupyter notebook exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cate software and the open data portal\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be querying the open data portal for sea ice concentration products as produced by the [Climate Change Initiative Sea Ice project](https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/sea-ice/). The [**open data portal**](https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/dashboard) hosts a variety of datasets on the [Jasmin infrastructure on the UK](https://jasmin.ac.uk/). These can be queried using the dedicated [Cate python module](https://cate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Cate allows retrieving data from the data portal and the web-interface which you find at [cate.climate.esa.int](https://cate.climate.esa.int) is build upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook exercise we will directly call Cate functions, and it will show you how these can be used in advanced workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the exercise\n",
    "To perform the exercise and execute the code in this notebook you can run it through the [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) service by clicking on the binder link below (if resources allow it). Alternatively, you can download/clone the notebooks from [github](https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate-edu) and run them through your own Jupyter notebook instance (this may initially take more time to setup, but does allow you to store your changes and extend the notebooks exercises to your own needs).\n",
