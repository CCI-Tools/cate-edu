# Exercise III

**Monitoring Land Cover Change in Kenya**

*Investigate the changes in the land cover
of Kenya between 1995, 2005, and 2015 using CATE.*

---

You have just reflected on the analyses of soil moisture data to identify 
and quantify droughts in Kenya. In this exercise, you will investigate the 
changes in the land cover of Kenya between 1995, 2005, and 2015. In this 
exercise, you will be using 
[CATE, (Software as a Service, CATE SaaS)](https://cate.climate.esa.int/). 
For more information on how to use this 
[cloud-based version of CATE](https://cate.climate.esa.int/) 
you are encouraged to review the 
[exercise on CATE SaaS](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/understanding-climate-change-using-satellite-data/1/steps/1271913)


## Exercise's objective

As droughts in Kenya appear to be becoming more frequent and more severe 
over time, the land cover is becoming progressively more arid. 
As a result, crop failures and livestock deaths lead to severe food 
shortages in Kenya. To mitigate the effects of climate change on food 
shortage in Kenya, aid programmes like 
[The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center](https://www.cimmyt.org/) 
are heading towards introducing drought-tolerant crops,
changing the land cover (see Figure 1).

## Exercise's tasks

1 - At the first step, make sure that you have access to
the [CATE Cloud Service](https://cate.climate.esa.int/).

2 - Check out the 
[Open Data Portal](https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/dashboard) 
where you can find information about the available Land Cover products.

*Figure 2: Land Cover Data in the Climate Office Website*

3 - You can also use CATE to find Land Cover Data. There are two Land Cover
data sets available in the CCI Open Data Portal data store: One at a
temporal resolution of 13 years, the other at a 1-year resolution. The
latter is also included in the CCI [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/) 
Data Store, so for this exercise, we are going to use that one.

![Figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCI-Tools/cate-edu/main/MOOC/images_E218/media/image3.png#center)

*Figure 3: Land Cover Data in the CCI Zarr Store*

As the data set covers the time range we are interested in, there is no
need to select a temporal subset. If you want to apply a spatial subset,
make sure you include Kenya. The bounding box is longitude \[33, 42\],
latitude \[-5, 5\] (Figure 4).

4 - The Land Cover Class is given as an index. The meanings of the indexes
are explained
[here](http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download/ESACCI-LC-QuickUserGuide-LC-Maps_v2-0-7.pdf).
As you can see, there is a dedicated colour bar that has been
preconfigured for Land Cover data and that is already applied in CATE.
You can change the colour bar if you activate the *STYLES* panel in the
lower right and then click the colour bar (Figure 5). However, we
recommend you stick to the dedicated Land Cover scheme.

*Figure 5: CATE\'s STYLES panel*

At the top right, you can switch to the *LAYERS* panel by selecting the
Layers symbol. If you do so, you will see that there is a time slider
that will allow you to select different time steps (Figure 6). The time
of the selected step is always displayed at the top of the world view.

*Figure 6: CATE\'s LAYERS panel*

Also, you may open a second world view, which you might find convenient
to compare maps: Simply click *New World View* from CATE\'s *VIEW*
panel, located at the lower right.

*Figure 7: CATE\'s view panel*

If you have opened more than one view, you can split these horizontally
or vertically using the icons in the top right corner (Figure 8).

icons to separate views are marked with a red circle.*

5 - Compare the Land Cover maps of Kenya for the years 1995, 2005 and 2015
(Figures 7, 8, and 9, respectively). Pay particular attention to
cropland. Values 10, 11, and 12 (in yellow) stand for rainfed cropland;
value 20 for irrigated or post-flooding cropland.

## Up next

Once you have done the exercise, it is time to discuss what you 
can learn from the data.
